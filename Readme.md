Project: Drive File Upload System (Local Version)

This is a local file upload system built using Node.js, express, Mongodb and Supabase. Users can register and log in to access the upload page. Without logging in, users cannot upload or download files. Files can be uploaded, viewed, and downloaded using right-click.

Note: Currently, the project runs on a local server, so only the developer can access and use it. It is not deployed for multiple users over the internet.
